Styling Rules:<br/>
End every line with a semicolon<br/>
Put curly braces on the same line as whatever is using them<br/>
Put a space after commas and before and after every operator<br/>
Always surround if/while/else/etc. content with curly braces<br/>
Always put if/while/else/etc. content on a new line<br/>
Put else and else if on the same line as the closing curly brace of the parent if<br/>
Initialize variables on a new line<br/>
Priority Chain: Efficiency > Readability > Compactness<br/>
Variable orders:<br/>
x -> y<br/>
width -> height<br/>
lowerlimit -> upperlimit<br/>
x -> y -> z<br/>
width -> height -> depth<br/>
